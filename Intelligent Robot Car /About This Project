# 🚘 Robot Car

Hello there!

This is a project I created along with my teammates as the final assignment for one of our **Embedded Systems** lab courses at university.

The project is a **robot car** that can be controlled wirelessly using a custom-made controller. It supports **multiple operation modes**, each demonstrating different embedded control techniques:


## 🔁 Modes of Operation

### 🚗 **Control Mode**
In this mode, the robot is manually controlled via a custom-built controller.

- The controller is built using an **Arduino Uno** and a **Bluetooth module**.
- Directional control is achieved using a **joystick**.
- Commands are sent wirelessly to the robot for real-time control.

---

### ⚫ **Line Follower Mode**
- The robot uses **grayscale sensors** to detect and follow a black line on the ground automatically.
- No user input is required once the mode is activated.

---

### 🚧 **Obstacle Avoidance Mode**
- In this autonomous mode, the robot moves forward while avoiding collisions.
- It uses distance sensing to detect obstacles and navigate around them intelligently.



## 🎮 The Custom Controller

The controller was designed with both functionality and flexibility in mind. It includes:

- 🔄 **Joystick** – for directional control in manual mode  
- 📟 **Arduino Uno** – core microcontroller  
- 📶 **Bluetooth Module** – wireless communication with the robot  
- 🔘 **Five Buttons**:
  - **Speed Control** button – sets the robot's speed
  - **Buzzer Trigger** – activates an on-board buzzer
  - **Light Control** – turns the robot’s lights on or off
  - **Mode Switch** – cycles between the operating modes
  - **OK/Set Button** – confirms mode selection or settings
