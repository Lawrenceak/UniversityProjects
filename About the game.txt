This is the game my teammate and I developed during our "Advanced Programming" course at university. The goal was to create a game using WinForms to demonstrate our deep understanding of programming concepts and to practice finding creative solutions to development challenges. In this project, I focused on the intro, menus, and the "Fish Frenzy" game, while my colleague developed the second game, "Soccer Slinger."
